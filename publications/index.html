This paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is 0.27 in 1D, as obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the non-negativity of the numerical solutions.

A key advantage of the AF method over standard finite volume schemes is its structure-preserving property, motivating the investigation of its asymptotic-preserving (AP) behavior in the diffusive scaling.

This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(2), A811–A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme.

Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> Zhihao Zhang, Huazhong Tang, and <strong>Junming Duan<sup>*</sup></strong> <br> <span>High-order accurate well-balanced energy stable finite difference schemes for multi-layer shallow water equations on fixed and adaptive moving meshes</span> <br> <em><strong>Journal of Computational Physics</strong></em>, 517: 113301, Nov 2024 <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113301" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08124" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper develops high-order well-balanced (WB) energy stable (ES) finite difference schemes for multi-layer (the number of layers M\geqslant2) shallow water equations (SWEs) on both fixed and adaptive moving meshes, extending our previous works [20,51]. To obtain an energy inequality, the convexity of an energy function for an arbitrary M is proved by finding recurrence relations of the leading principal minors or the quadratic forms of the Hessian matrix of the energy function with respect to the conservative variables, which is more involved than the single-layer case due to the coupling between the layers in the energy function. An important ingredient in developing high-order semi-discrete ES schemes is the construction of a two-point energy conservative (EC) numerical flux. In pursuit of the WB property, a sufficient condition for such EC fluxes is given with compatible discretizations of the source terms similar to the single-layer case. It can be decoupled into M identities individually for each layer, making it convenient to construct a two-point EC flux for the multi-layer system. To suppress possible oscillations near discontinuities, WENO-based dissipation terms are added to the high-order WB EC fluxes, which gives semi-discrete high-order WB ES schemes. Fully-discrete schemes are obtained by employing high-order explicit SSP-RK methods and proved to preserve the lake at rest. The schemes are further extended to moving meshes based on a modified energy function for a reformulated system, relying on the techniques proposed in [51]. Numerical experiments are conducted for some two- and three-layer cases to validate the high-order accuracy, WB and ES properties, and high efficiency of the schemes, with a suitable amount of dissipation chosen by estimating the maximal wave speed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the eigenstructure of the multi-layer system.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> <strong>Junming Duan</strong>, Qian Wang, and Jan S.

This paper presents a data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of pressure sensors located on the surface of a UAV. The model is built on a linear term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of surface pressure, with the basis extracted from simulation data and the basis coefficients determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of optimal sensor locations, which are obtained by using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network that is trained to bridge the gap between the DEIM prediction and the ground truth, especially when only low-fidelity simulation data are available. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a two-dimensional NACA0015 airfoil and numerical simulation data of the dynamic stall of a three-dimensional drone. Numerical results demonstrate that the machine-learning-enhanced model is accurate, efficient, and robust, even for the NACA0015 case, in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind tunnel experiments.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> <strong>Junming Duan<sup>*</sup></strong> and Jan S.

However, there are still many challenges to constructing efficient ROMs for time-dependent parametrized problems. Using a linear reduced space is inefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space. The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately, including transport-dominated problems.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> Jie Wang, <strong>Junming Duan</strong>, Zhiwei Ma, and Wei Zhang <br> <span>An adaptive moving mesh finite difference scheme for tokamak magneto-hydrodynamic simulations</span> <br> <em><strong>Computer Physics Communications</strong></em>, 294: 108951, Jan 2024 <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2023.108951" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>An adaptive moving mesh finite difference scheme is developed for tokamak magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, based on the CLT code (S.

They are built on the numerical approximation of the modified SWMHD equations with the Janhunen source term. First, the second-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete entropy conservative (EC) schemes are constructed, satisfying the entropy identity for the given convex entropy function and preserving the steady states of the lake at rest (with zero magnetic field). The key is to match both discretizations for the fluxes and the non-flat river bed bottom and Janhunen source terms, and to find the affordable EC fluxes of the second-order EC schemes. Next, by using the second-order EC schemes as building block, high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete EC schemes are proposed. Then, the high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete ES schemes are derived by adding a suitable dissipation term to the EC scheme with the WENO reconstruction of the scaled entropy variables in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the EC schemes. After that, the semi-discrete schemes are integrated in time by using the high-order strong stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to obtain the fully-discrete high-order well-balanced schemes. The ES property of the Lax-Friedrichs flux is also proved and then the positivity-preserving ES schemes are studied by using the positivity-preserving flux limiters.

First, a sufficient condition is proved for the two-point entropy conservative (EC) flux, by mimicking the derivation of the continuous entropy identity in curvilinear coordinates and using the discrete geometric conservation laws given by the conservative metrics method. Based on such sufficient condition, the EC fluxes for the RHD equations in curvilinear coordinates are derived and the second-order accurate semi-discrete EC schemes are developed to satisfy the entropy identity for the given convex entropy pair.

It is built on the modified RMHD equations with a particular source term, which is analogous to the Powell‘s eight-wave formulation and can be symmetrized so that an "entropy pair" is obtained. We design an affordable "fully consistent" two-point entropy conservative flux, which is not only consistent with the physical flux, but also maintains the zero parallel magnetic component, and then construct high-order accurate semi-discrete entropy stable DG schemes based on the quadrature rules and the entropy conservative and stable fluxes. The Lax-Friedrichs flux is proven to be entropy stable when its viscosity coefficient is chosen as the speed of light, and the other two entropy stable fluxes are also derived by adding the dissipation terms to our proposed entropy conservative flux and compared to the Lax-Friedrichs flux by using numerical experiments in terms of the CPU time and accuracy. All three entropy stable numerical fluxes maintain the zero parallel magnetic component in one dimension. The resulting entropy stable DG schemes satisfy the semi-discrete "entropy inequality" for the given "entropy pair" and are integrated in time by using the high-order explicit strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes to get further the fully-discrete nodal DG schemes. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy and the ability to capture discontinuities of our schemes with the help of the TVB limiter. Moreover, our entropy conservative flux is compared to an existing flux through some numerical tests. The results show that the zero parallel magnetic component in the numerical flux can help to decrease the error in the parallel magnetic component in one-dimensional tests, but two entropy conservative fluxes give similar results since the error in the magnetic field divergence seems dominated in the two-dimensional tests.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> <strong>Junming Duan</strong> and Huazhong Tang <br> <span>High-order accurate entropy stable finite difference schemes for one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics</span> <br> <em><strong>Advances in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics</strong></em>, 12(1): 1–29, Jan 2020 <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.4208/aamm.oa-2019-0124" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06092" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper develops the high-order accurate entropy stable finite difference schemes for one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic equations.

Unlike multi-stage Runge-Kutta methods used in the Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes, the ADER scheme is one-stage in time discretization, which is desirable in many applications. The ADER scheme used here relies on a local continuous spacetime Galerkin predictor instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure to achieve high order accuracy both in space and time. In such predictor step, a local Cauchy problem in each cell is solved based on a weak formulation of the original equations in spacetime. The resulting spacetime representation of the numerical solution provides the temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying DG solution. The scheme is formulated in the modal space and the volume integral and the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces can be explicitly written. The explicit formulae of the scheme at third order is provided on two-dimensional structured meshes. The computational complexity of the ADER-DG scheme is compared to that of the RKDG scheme. Numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme.</p> </div> </span> </li> <li> <span> Dan Ling, <strong>Junming Duan</strong>, and Huazhong Tang <br> <span>Physical-constraints-preserving Lagrangian finite volume schemes for one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics</span> <br> <em><strong>Journal of Computational Physics</strong></em>, 396: 507–543, Nov 2019 <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.06.055" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10625" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper studies the physical-constraints-preserving (PCP) Lagrangian finite volume schemes for one- and two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) equations.

The key is that the intermediate states in the HLLC Riemann solver are shown to be admissible or PCP when the HLLC wave speeds are estimated suitably.
