The ADER scheme used here relies on a local continuous spacetime Galerkin predictor instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure to achieve high order accuracy both in space and time. In such predictor step, a local Cauchy problem in each cell is solved based on a weak formulation of the original equations in spacetime. The resulting spacetime representation of the numerical solution provides the temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying DG solution. The scheme is formulated in the modal space and the volume integral and the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces can be explicitly written.

  abstract       = {The relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) equations govern the fluid dynamics at nearly the speed of light when relativistic description is necessary, e.g., in investigating astrophysical and cosmological phenomena from stellar to galactic scales.
Due to the relativistic effect, especially the appearance of the Lorentz factor, the nonlinearity of the RHD and RMHD equations becomes much stronger than the non-relativistic case, which makes it difficult and challenging to design and analyze high-order accurate numerical methods.
This thesis studies high-order accurate entropy stable (ES) numerical methods for the ideal special RHD and RMHD equations.
Their physical solutions satisfy the second law of thermodynamics, or the entropy conditions (entropy identity/entropy inequality) in mathematics, which are used to single out the physical relevant solution, and also give stabilities that further improve the robustness of the numerical methods, thus it is of great significance to design numerical methods which satisfy the entropy conditions in the discrete level.
Our main contributions are described in the following four parts.
  1. High-order accurate ES finite difference schemes for the RHD equations are developed.
For the thermodynamical entropy based convex entropy pair, affordable two-point entropy conservative (EC) fluxes are technically constructed based on properly chosen parameter vectors,
then the semi-discrete second-order accurate EC schemes satisfying the semi-discrete entropy identity are obtained.
Utilizing the linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes as ``high-order" EC fluxes, the semi-discrete high-order accurate EC schemes are proposed.
After that, the high-order accurate semi-discrete ES schemes satisfying the semi-discrete entropy inequalities are derived by adding suitable dissipation terms to the EC schemes with the WENO reconstruction of the scaled entropy variables in order to suppress the unphysical oscillations of the EC schemes.
The semi-discrete schemes are integrated in time by using the high-order explicit  strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) schemes to obtain the fully-discrete schemes.
For all the three-dimensional problems considered in the thesis, the message passing interface (MPI) based distributed parallel computing is implemented.
The numerical experiments show that the schemes are high-order accurate, EC/ES, and shock-capturing.
  2. In order to further improve the resolution and computational efficiency, the ES adaptive moving mesh schemes for the RHD equations are developed. They are built on the RHD equations in curvilinear coordinates.
Utilizing the geometric conservation laws (GCLs), the entropy conditions and the sufficient condition for the two-point EC flux are derived.
Based on such sufficient condition, the two-point EC fluxes for the RHD equations in curvilinear coordinates are derived, then the second-order accurate semi-discrete EC schemes are developed to satisfy the entropy identity.
Combing the rotational invariance of the RHD equations and the slope limiter based linear reconstruction, the second-order dissipation terms in curvilinear coordinates are designed, and then the second-order ES schemes are obtained.
One of the key to the constructions of the EC/ES schemes is to properly discretize the metric coefficients introduced by coordinate transformation, such that the discrete GCLs are satisfied.
Two approaches are proposed to update the cell volume, and their efficiency and accuracy are compared.
It is also proved that the fully-discrete schemes obtained by using the explicit SSP-RK2/SSP-RK3 preserve the physical constant states.
The mesh points are adaptively moved or redistributed by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation of the mesh adaptation functional on the computational mesh with suitably chosen monitor functions.
Several numerical experiments show that the ES adaptive moving mesh schemes have good shock-capturing ability, and are more efficient than their counterparts on the uniform mesh.
Based on the linear combinations of the two-point EC fluxes and the WENO based high-order dissipation terms, the schemes are also extended to higher-order accuracy.
  3. High-order accurate ES finite-difference schemes for the RMHD equations are developed.
Compared to the RHD case, it is not straightforward to obtain the entropy pair, since the pair based on the thermodynamical entropy is not yet an entropy pair of the RMHD equations.
Some particular source terms can be added so that we can obtain the symmetrizable RMHD equations, and then the entropy pair and the corresponding entropy conditions are derived.
Due to the coupling of the magnetic field and Lorentz factor, the algebraic operations in deriving the two-point EC flux become much more complicated.
We technically construct an affordable two-point EC flux, which is not only consistent with the physical flux, but also maintains the zero parallel magnetic component.
Through the computation of some one-dimensional Riemann problems, it is found that the numerical results are better when the parallel magnetic field component is zero.
The discretizations of the source terms and the EC fluxes are matched to obtain high-accurate EC schemes.
After that, by adding the WENO reconstruction based high-order dissipation terms, high-order ES schemes are proposed.
  4. High-order accurate ES nodal DG schemes for the RMHD equations are developed.
Different from the high-order accurate ES finite difference schemes, the dissipation terms of the ES fluxes can be designed not only based on the jump of the entropy variables, but also based on that of conservative variables.
We construct two kinds of ES fluxes by adding dissipation terms to the EC flux, and prove that the generalized Lax-Friedrichs flux with the viscosity coefficient taken as the speed of light is an ES flux.
By choosing Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) quadrature rule to compute the integrals in the DG schemes, and collocating the numerical solutions at LGL points in each cell, the DG scheme can be recast into the nodal formulation, and the resulting discrete operators satisfy the summation-by-parts (SBP) property.
It is proved that the nodal DG schemes satisfy the semi-discrete entropy identity by using two-point EC flux in both volume and interface integrations, and the schemes satisfy the semi-discrete entropy inequality when the EC and ES fluxes are used in the volume integration and interface integration, respectively.
The present schemes are constructed on Cartesian mesh, and will be extended to moving mesh and general domain in the future.},

  abstract       = {This paper proposes high-order accurate well-balanced (WB) energy stable (ES) adaptive moving mesh finite difference schemes for the shallow water equations (SWEs) with non-flat bottom topography. To enable the construction of the ES schemes on moving meshes, a reformulation of the SWEs is introduced, with the bottom topography as an additional conservative variable that evolves in time. The corresponding energy inequality is derived based on a modified energy function, then the reformulated SWEs and energy inequality are transformed into curvilinear coordinates. A two-point energy conservative (EC) flux is constructed, and high-order EC schemes based on such a flux are proved to be WB that they preserve the lake at rest. Then high-order ES schemes are derived by adding suitable dissipation terms to the EC schemes, which are newly designed to maintain the WB and ES properties simultaneously. The adaptive moving mesh strategy is performed by iteratively solving the Euler-Lagrangian equations of a mesh adaptation functional. The fully-discrete schemes are obtained by using the explicit strong-stability preserving third-order Runge-Kutta method. Several numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy, WB and ES properties, shock-capturing ability, and high efficiency of the schemes.},

  abstract       = {Reduced-order models are indispensable for multi-query or real-time problems. However, there are still many challenges to constructing efficient ROMs for time-dependent parametrized problems. Using a linear reduced space is inefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space. The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately, including transport-dominated problems.},

This paper presents a data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of pressure sensors located on the surface of a UAV. The model is built on a linear term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of surface pressure, with the basis extracted from simulation data and the basis coefficients determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of optimal sensor locations, which are obtained by using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network that is trained to bridge the gap between the DEIM prediction and the ground truth, especially when only low-fidelity simulation data are available. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a two-dimensional NACA0015 airfoil and numerical simulation data of the dynamic stall of a three-dimensional drone. Numerical results demonstrate that the machine-learning-enhanced model is accurate, efficient, and robust, even for the NACA0015 case, in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind tunnel experiments.},

Our numerical scheme is built on the MHD equations in curvilinear coordinates, based on a coordinate transformation from the physical domain to a computational domain. The scheme is constructed on a uniform Cartesian computational mesh that is obtained from a non-uniform adaptive moving mesh in the physical domain through the coordinate transformation. Mesh points in the physical domain in general move and concentrate in the vicinity of solutions with rapid variations by solving an adaptive mesh equation, whilst total number of mesh points remains unchanged. The local resolution can be significantly increased and computational resource is largely reduced. Comparison between results obtained with the original uniform mesh and the new adaptive moving mesh is carried out by simulation of the linear and nonlinear 2/1 tearing mode, linear and nonlinear 1/1 resistive internal kink mode. It is found that the adaptive moving mesh scheme possesses better numerical stability and convergence.},

  abstract       = {This paper develops high-order well-balanced (WB) energy stable (ES) finite difference schemes for multi-layer (the number of layers $M\geqslant2$) shallow water equations (SWEs) on both fixed and adaptive moving meshes, extending our previous works [20,51]. To obtain an energy inequality, the convexity of an energy function for an arbitrary $M$ is proved by finding recurrence relations of the leading principal minors or the quadratic forms of the Hessian matrix of the energy function with respect to the conservative variables, which is more involved than the single-layer case due to the coupling between the layers in the energy function. An important ingredient in developing high-order semi-discrete ES schemes is the construction of a two-point energy conservative (EC) numerical flux. In pursuit of the WB property, a sufficient condition for such EC fluxes is given with compatible discretizations of the source terms similar to the single-layer case. It can be decoupled into $M$ identities individually for each layer, making it convenient to construct a two-point EC flux for the multi-layer system. To suppress possible oscillations near discontinuities, WENO-based dissipation terms are added to the high-order WB EC fluxes, which gives semi-discrete high-order WB ES schemes. Fully-discrete schemes are obtained by employing high-order explicit SSP-RK methods and proved to preserve the lake at rest. The schemes are further extended to moving meshes based on a modified energy function for a reformulated system, relying on the techniques proposed in [51]. Numerical experiments are conducted for some two- and three-layer cases to validate the high-order accuracy, WB and ES properties, and high efficiency of the schemes, with a suitable amount of dissipation chosen by estimating the maximal wave speed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the eigenstructure of the multi-layer system.},

Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.},

  abstract  = {The Active Flux (AF) is a compact, high-order finite volume scheme that allows more flexibility by introducing additional point value degrees of freedom at cell interfaces. This paper proposes a positivity-preserving (PP) AF scheme for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamics, where the Godunov-Powell source term is employed to deal with the divergence-free constraint. For the evolution of the cell average, apart from the standard conservative finite volume method for the flux derivative, the nonconservative source term is built on the quadratic reconstruction in each cell, which maintains the compact stencil in the AF scheme. For the point value update, the local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) flux vector splitting is adopted for the flux derivative, originally proposed in [Duan, Barsukow, and Klingenberg, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 47(2), A811--A837, 2025], and a central difference is used to discretize the divergence in the source term. A parametrized flux limiter and a scaling limiter are presented to preserve the density and pressure positivity by blending the AF scheme with the first-order PP LLF scheme with the source term. To suppress oscillations, a new shock sensor considering the divergence error is proposed, which is used to compute the blending coefficients for the cell average. Several numerical tests are conducted to verify the third-order accuracy, PP property, and shock-capturing ability of the scheme. The key role of the Godunov-Powell source term and its suitable discretization in controlling divergence error is also validated.},

A key advantage of the AF method over standard finite volume schemes is its structure-preserving property, motivating the investigation of its asymptotic-preserving (AP) behavior in the diffusive scaling. We show that the JS-based AF method without any modification is AP for solving the hyperbolic heat equation, in the sense that the limit scheme is a discretization of the limit heat equation.

  abstract  = {The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method originally proposed for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, in which cell averages and point values at cell interfaces are evolved simultaneously. This paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is 0.27 in 1D, as obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the non-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.},
