Hosted by The Ohio State University, also supported by Honda, the Mobility Innovation eXchange in Aero/Acoustics ([MIXA](https://u.osu.edu/mixa/)) virtual symposium series presents talks on recent achievements, innovative tools, and current problems being faced by mobility researchers in aerodynamics and wind noise (aero/acoustics) test and simulation communities from industry, government labs, and research universities.
Participants also have the opportunity to use Honda’s world-class HALO Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel.
The organizers are Dr. Kevin Disotell and Prof. Lian Duan, who holds the Honda Endowed Chair in Transportation in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The Ohio State University.
I am excited to be invited as the keynote speaker for MIXA Spring 2025 [[announcement]](/assets/talks/MIXA_Spring_2025.pdf).
